                          the towns in the region are ancient, and many were important centres in medieval Russia. <br>
                          The Golden Ring trail as it stands includes the following eight cities:<br> Sergiyev Posad,<br> 
                          Pereslavl-Zalessky,<br> 
                          Rostov,<br>

          <p>Looking for something to do in Moscow? While St. Petersburg may claim to be the capital of Russian culture, Moscow may well claim to be its birthplace.<br><br>

            Moscow’s architectural character was defined largely by the Russian provinces. Being located on the crossroads of Europe and the Asiatic steppe, it had absorbed these diverse influences and created its own distinctive style. The streets of Moscow reflected a mixture of oriental customs, colours and motifs.<br><br>

            There are only a few cities in the world where so many writers are memorialised in statute form as in Moscow. Being the home of many legendary writers, Moscow has paid its tribute to them by immortalising them in statuary. Walking around Moscow, you are amazed by the number of statutes, busts and plaques dedicated to these famous names. It gives one a unique pleasure to walk the streets and pavements where these legendary people have left their footprints.<br><br>

            Whenever you choose to visit the charming capital of Russia you will always find something to do – our brief reviews could be your guide to the best events taking place in Moscow.</p>

          Archaeological evidence indicates that the territory of the future Moscow has been occupied since Neolithic epoch. The oldest settlements, dated as three thousand years before our era, were discovered within the area of the present-day city. The first reference to “the village of Moscow” was made in an old Russian manuscript of 1147. In 1156, Prince Yuri Vladimirovich Dolgoruky erected timber walls on the present-day site of the Kremlin.

              <p id="redsquer">

                No place better represents Russia than Red Square (Krasnaya Ploshchad). Its name comes from the word “krasnyi”, which once meant “beautiful”, and has only come to mean “red” in contemporary Russian language. The name became official in the middle of the 17th century - previously it had been Trinity Square. <br>
                Entering the Red Square through the Resurrection Gate, you can see the Kazan Cathedral on your left. The amazing State History Museum is located in the north end of the square. The enormous, elaborate facade occupying the east side of the square is the State Department Store, better known as GUM. The mighty towers of the Kremlin dominate the west side of the square. Lenin’s Mausoleum, which is located near the centre of the Square, is still open for visitors. At the far end of Red Square, the colourful confusion of onion domes and tent peaks is Cathedral of St Basil the Blessed, the 16th-century church that is probably Moscow’s most recognizable sight.</p>

              <p id="redsquer">
                The word “Kremlin” simply means a fortress in the Russian language. Every ancient Russian city had its own kremlin, but none has acquired the symbolic significance that Moscow's Kremlin commands. The Moscow Kremlin has acted over the centuries as a fortress, a religious centre and the focus of Russian political power, and hence the very name has come, over time, to stand for much more than a purely geographical landmark. <br>
                Nineteen towers were added to the walls of the Kremlin in the 1490s, all of which are different in design. “Спасская башня - Saviour Tower” has become one of the best-known symbols of the Kremlin. Built in 1491 by Pietro Solari, it celebrated its 500th anniversary in the year 1991. <br>
                Of the three cathedrals grouped together in Cathedral Square inside the Kremlin, the most important is “Успенский Собор - the Cathedral of the Dormition,” where, until 1917, the highest state ceremonies took place, including coronations of the tsars.

              <h5>Moscow Seven’s Sisters</h5>
              <img id="sevensist" src="img/frimsk/image006.jpg" alt="">
              <p id="redsquer">

                The Seven Sisters, or ‘Stalin’s high-rises Russian: Stalinskiye vysotki, are among Moscow’s best examples of Stalinist architecture, a term given to Soviet architecture under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party. Constructed between the mid-1940s and the early 1950s, these high-rises came to symbolize the new Moscow, which was perceived as a victorious city that had overcome the hardships of war and entered a peaceful new era. <br>
                The Soviet Baroque architecture that The Sisters embody is seen by some as unattractive; the buildings themselves are somewhat controversial due to the fact that some see them, with their looming size and sinister-looking spires, as grim reminders of the Stalinist repression. However, while debate still continues on whether these buildings are beauties or beasts, there is no doubt that they have become a major representation of the Soviet era and modern-day Moscow.

                One of the most visited and favorite places of rest and entertainment for guests and residents of the capital is the Park, Exhibition and Cultural Complex called VDNHa. The exhibition was established February 17, 1935 as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV). In 1959 the park was renamed Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy or VDNKh. The complex consisted of themed pavilions for each of the union republics where the latter exhibited their most outstanding achievements. A year-round program of cultural and recreational activities offers leisure activities for every taste. In the winter the country’s largest skating rink offers an enormous number of events-concerts, shows, various festive openings, sporting events and activities for children. There are unforgettable children’s Christmas party- festivals in a high rope park. In summer the famous fountains perform their beauty, while concerts, festivals and exhibitions are also performed.

                Kolomenskoye is one of the most ancient places of human habitation within modern Moscow. The history of Kolomenskoye is intertwined with the history of the Russian monarchy. It was a home for Peter the Great during his early years. It was the scene of festivities marking the coronations of Catherine I, Peter II and Empresses Anna and Elizabeth. Peter II often hunted in the woods nearby, and in the late 18th century Catherine the Great used to come here with her grandchildren, including the future Emperor Alexander I. <br>
                Apart from the innumerable architectural and historical monuments, visitors also have access to a well-groomed park and a wonderful embankment perfect for walks. There are all the leisure facilities necessary to relax in summer as well as in winter: cafés and kiosks with food and souvenirs, free toilets, etc. There are information stands all over the museum reserve, providing information both in Russian and English as well as in Braille.

            Moscow has always been and still remains the city of theatres. Every evening the doors of Moscow theatres open to streams of theatre-goers. The best Moscow theatres devoted themselves todevelopment of the principals of directing and acting laid down by Stanislavsky, Meerhold, Nemerovich-Danchenko, Vachtangov and others. Even if you do not consider yourself to be passionate fan of the stage, the evening spent in the auditorium of one of the metropolitan theaters will make a lasting impression on you and charge you with powerful energy.

                <p id="redsquer">

                  The State Academic Bolshoi Theatre of Russia is one of Russia’s most important musical theaters, world-renowned for its ballet and opera productions. Nowadays performances and concerts are held in three venues: <br> the Historic Stage, the New Stage, and the Beethoven Hall. The building itself is one of Moscow's most symbolic sites, a truly impressive example of Russian Classical architecture that faces the Kremlin walls, and some fairly tacky open air bars and restaurants, with proud indifference. The Bolshoi is the second biggest opera house in Europe (after La Scala). <br>
                  Tickets to the Bolshoi Theatre cost a pretty penny today. If you don’t have enough money or time to see a performance on the Historic Stage, you should pay attention to the theatre tours. Guided tours in English and Russian are run a few times a week in the morning, starting from the central entrance. You’d better get in a queue in advance, as the demand is huge and seats are limited.

                  The State Academic Maly Theater of Russia is perhaps the most traditional theater; its repertoire consists of classical Russian and foreign plays since its opening. It began to be called small in comparison with the neighboring building of the Bolshoi Theater, but in terms of significance for Russian theatrical culture, the Maly Theater is not inferior to the Bolshoi. At one time, the two theaters had one troupe, and for the convenience of the actors, the buildings were connected by an underground passage.
                  The Maly Theatre has always attracted remarkable actors, directors and artists. Dozens are winners of various state awards and titles. Many visitors come here to enjoy brilliant acting by the older generation of actors.
                  If you want to enjoy classical Russian theatre, see plays written by Chekhov, Pushkin, Ostrovsky and Gogol the Maly is probably one of the best choices. The theatre follows Russian drama tradition and makes classical productions.

                <p id="redsquer">
                  The history of the theater’s ballet group (there is also an opera group) goes back to the late 1920’s, when Moscow acquired a dance company that called itself Art Ballet. Its production caught the ballet lovers’ attention right away. The audiences were captivated by the performers’ excellence as ballet dancers and drama actors. The new theatre followed the artistic principles of its founders, who applied the system of the Moscow Art Theatre to opera and ballet. Both Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko rejected the current conception of opera as ‘costume concert’. They wanted to bring it closer to drama and comedy, revealing the main idea of the plot through psychologically motivated action. <br>
                  Whilst it is a comfortable second behind the Bolshoi in terms of its fame, popularity and the caliber of its actors, yet it compares favourably in its abundance of contemporary productions, continuous collaboration with world famous directors, and willingness to experiment. The theatre fuses traditional aspects of theatre with more daring elements.

It was the first facility of its kind in the USSR; in the interwar period such buildings were being built in many countries of Europe and America. The ‘pioneers’ were the Germans. Special projector by famous ‘Carl Zeiss’ was specially made also for Moscow. <br>

              In 2000s the reconstruction of the Planetarium upon the project of A. Anisimov, took place.

This building is among the finest architectural examples of the Russian Empire style. <br>

              The Manezh was built in 1817 in honor of the 5th anniversary of Russia’s victory in the 1812 war. Then it was called «Exerzierhaus», building, intended for military drills.

It incorporates the latest technology and provides all the necessary facilities for visitors to enjoy themselves. <br>

      <p> <b>St. Petersburg</b>  is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful places on earth and virtually any building in the large historic centre, threaded with canals dotted with baroque bridges, can be considered an attraction. This is a magical city, with a long list of major attractions. <br>Its Hermitage Museum, housed in the Winter Palace of the Romanov Dynasty, is both one of the world's greatest and oldest collections of art, treasure, and antiquities, and one of its most beautiful buildings. <br><br>

      Situated in a swampy river delta subject to deep winter freezes, hot and humid summers, and periodic flooding in the autumn, the city started life as a rough and ready military outpost but grew rapidly. <br>Over the course of the eighteenth century, the city center began to assume the architectural face it presents to the world today, as the baroque extravagances of Empress Elizabeth gradually gave way to the neoclassical style favored by Catherine the Great. <br><br>

      Intended by the indomitable Peter the Great as Russia’s “window to Europe,” St. Petersburg (named in honor of the Tsar’s patron saint, the Apostle Peter) quickly outshone Moscow to become the political, economic, and cultural center of the Russian Empire.</p>

      <h4>St. Petersburg Places of Interest</h4>

      <p id="how">
      How often in my exile grieving <br>
      In my wandering fate, <br>
      O Moscow, have I thought of you!<br>
      Moscow. How much there is in this sound<br>
      That Russian hearts are heaving<br>
      How much echoes in it!<br>
      Alexander Pushkin Eugene Onegin (1823-1831)<br>

      <p id="archelog">
      Archaeological evidence indicates that the territory of the future Moscow has been occupied since Neolithic epoch. The oldest settlements, dated as three thousand years before our era, were discovered within the area of the present-day city. The first reference to “the village of Moscow” was made in an old Russian manuscript of 1147. In 1156, Prince Yuri Vladimirovich Dolgoruky erected timber walls on the present-day site of the Kremlin.

      <h5>Red Square</h5>
      <img src="img/frimsk/image004.jpg"  alt="">
      <p id="redsquer">

      No place better represents Russia than Red Square (Krasnaya Ploshchad). Its name comes from the word “krasnyi”, which once meant “beautiful”, and has only come to mean “red” in contemporary Russian language. The name became official in the middle of the 17th century - previously it had been Trinity Square. <br>
      Entering the Red Square through the Resurrection Gate, you can see the Kazan Cathedral on your left. The amazing State History Museum is located in the north end of the square. The enormous, elaborate facade occupying the east side of the square is the State Department Store, better known as GUM.  The mighty towers of the Kremlin dominate the west side of the square.  Lenin’s Mausoleum, which is located near the centre of the Square, is still open for visitors. At the far end of Red Square, the colourful confusion of onion domes and tent peaks is Cathedral of St Basil the Blessed, the 16th-century church that is probably Moscow’s most recognizable sight.</p>

      <h5>The Kremlin: Heart of Moscow - Heart of Russia</h5>
      <img src="img/frimsk/image005.jpg" alt="">
      <p id="redsquer">
      The word “Kremlin” simply means a fortress in the Russian language. Every ancient Russian city had its own kremlin, but none has acquired the symbolic significance that Moscow’s Kremlin commands. The Moscow Kremlin has acted over the centuries as a fortress, a religious centre and the focus of Russian political power, and hence the very name has come, over time, to stand for much more than a purely geographical landmark. <br>
      Nineteen towers were added to the walls of the Kremlin in the 1490s, all of which are different in design. “Спасская башня - Saviour Tower” has become one of the best-known symbols of the Kremlin. Built in 1491 by Pietro Solari, it celebrated its 500th anniversary in the year 1991. <br>
      Of the three cathedrals grouped together in Cathedral Square inside the Kremlin, the most important is “Успенский Собор - the Cathedral of the Dormition,” where, until 1917, the highest state ceremonies took place, including coronations of the tsars.

Alexander Nevskiy was born in this town in 1220. It is situated on the bank of Plescheyevo Lake. It is a large and rather uncommon lake, where you can go as far as 50 meters from the bank. <br>
                    There are many churches and monasteries in the town but contrarily to Suzdal and Rostov, where they are concentrated on the small territory, here they are dispersed all over the town. The most important monasteries of the town, located near the lake are Nikitsky, Goritsky and Nikolsky. Totally there are 5 monasteries in this small town.

                <p><b>Rostov-the-Great </b> was founded in the middle of the XI century on the beautiful Nero Lake. It is almost three hundred years older than Moscow. Since the XII century the town has been called Rostov-the-Great. The word "Great" referred to the concentration of the civic and religious authorities in the town. <br>
                 Rostov has been developing as an economic, religious and cultural centre because of its favourable location on the northern Russia trade route. The town preserves two-storey wooden houses of the XIX century with Russian architectural features, as well as the monuments of civic architecture called Myitny and Gostiny  Dvors. Rostov is the only town in Russia where the old art of finite (decorative designs and portraiture on enamel) has been preserved.

                <p><b>Ivanovo</b> is quite a big city (450 thousand inhabitants), located between Suzdal (70 kilometers to the south) and Kostroma. Ivanovo is a real Russian industrial city: grey residential buildings, dirty streets, polluted atmosphere, relics of the Soviet times kept intact. Perhaps, you will be happy just to go through this city, but it will be the most interesting stop along the Golden Ring if you want to get the taste of 'industrial' Russian province.
